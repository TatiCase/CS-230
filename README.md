# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room is a mobile app game creator with experience and success launching a puzzle competition game on the Android platform. The client's goal was to develop a web-based version of its current Android app and make the game available across multiple platforms and devices.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I completed a comprehensive recommendation section outlining key areas for the client’s consideration. These includie the host operating system (OS), memory and storage management solutions on host servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of leveraging serverless architecture to launch the product. I made a strong case as to why a Windows platform is the best choice for the client.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Analyzing the UML class diagram proved beneficial in understanding the structure and relationship between app components. This helped in developing specific classes and straightforward methods.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
The evaluation section comparing and contrasting popular OSs could be improved with a deeper dive into the differences between the platforms on the client side. The web browser is the main client-side concern because it is the main engine running the app for the client. Information on the differences between OSs for web-based solutions was hard to find.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
Key needs to consider for the user when developing web based apps are speed and usability. Look and feel of the program are also important, but less so when compared to speed and usability. A user may continue to use the app if they don’t care for the look, but will leave the site if it is slow. User needs are of paramount consideration because, as the product’s consumer, they are the ultimate source of revenue for the client.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I focused on high level objectives and worked them through varying iterations to create the final solution. In this case, The Gaming Room's business objectives were broken down into functional requirements outlining the key pieces of functionality needed to meet those objectives. Functional requirements were further broken down into technical requirements that outlined the technical approach to completion. Technical requirements were then be translated into design documents, architecture, and code that fulfills those requirements and delivers the program.
